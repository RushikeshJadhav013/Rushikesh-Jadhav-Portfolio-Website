Portfolio Website with Contact Form | [Rushikesh Jadhav]

Developed a dynamic and responsive portfolio website utilizing HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript to showcase my skills and projects. The website features a sleek design 
with smooth navigation and an interactive user interface.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: Ensured optimal user experience across various devices, from 
desktops to mobiles.
Project Showcase: Highlighted my work through a dedicated section with project 
details and images.
Contact Form Integration: Implemented a functional contact form using JavaScript 
for seamless communication with visitors.
Validation and Security: Incorporated form validation to enhance user input accuracy 
and included security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.


This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in front-end technologies but also 
showcases my attention to detail and commitment to creating user-friendly web experiences.
